# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A Computer Technologist with a knack for developing innovative technology solutions. I have always harbored a passion for technology, a trait that is reflected in my academic and professional journey.

I just completed a 4 year course in Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Technology from Maseno University, a prestigious institution in Kisumu, Kenya. In addition, I completed a comprehensive Software Engineering program from ALX Africa, where I honed my full-stack software development skills and gained proficiency in numerous programming languages like C, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

My love for technology extends beyond the classrooms; I have participated in Software Development Hackathon challenges and developed effective solutions, like a missing children search tool, which is currently being incubated into the Children Protection Information Management System (CPIMS).

My GitHub portfolio hosts a broad range of projects that showcase my competencies in Python, C, and Java among other languages, alongside my proficiency in frameworks like Flask and Django, and database management using MySQL. Some of my most notable projects include ImageSearch, a facial recognition search tool; AskAI, a focused chatbot for question-answering; and PrintAI, a comprehensive website with extensive functionality.

In addition to my technical skills, I am a strong communicator, dependable team player, and possess robust leadership abilities. I am known for my creative and innovative approach to problem-solving and my strong work ethic. My enthusiasm and positivity have often been commended and contribute to my consistent desire to learn and continuously improve.

Being an avid follower of technology trends, I have a particular interest in Software engineering, AI and IoT trends, Data Science and Analytics. This has enabled me to stay updated and continue my journey to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology.
