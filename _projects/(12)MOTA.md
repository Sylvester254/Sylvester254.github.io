## Overview

MOTA is a finance management application I developed using Python and Tkinter GUI framework.

-The application allows me to add, edit, and delete clients, as well as record transactions for each client.

## Tech stack
Currently, it's built with Tkinter and SQLite for data storage. 

I'm working on another version that will use Pyside6 GUI which I find better suited and modern for this project.
I'll also have a chance to explore and learn a different GUI.
