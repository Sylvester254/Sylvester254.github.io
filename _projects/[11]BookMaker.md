## Overview

Automated BookMaker is a Python-based tool designed to streamline the book publication process by automatically generating well-formatted printable PDF books and ebooks. It leverages open-source libraries to create professional, US Royal size books complete with preface pages, title pages, content pages, and closing pages. The tool also generates a matching cover page and a spine that adjusts its width according to the book's page count. This automation makes book publication efficient, allowing for the rapid creation of print-ready and e-book formats suitable for platforms like Amazon.
