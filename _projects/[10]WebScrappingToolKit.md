"Museum Sites Automation" is a comprehensive collection of Python scripts designed to streamline the process of downloading images and metadata from various renowned museum and art gallery websites. Each script in the collection is tailored to accommodate the unique webpage structures and data formats of different institutions, showcasing versatility and precision in web scraping and automation.

## Workflow
The projects in this collection follow a structured and comprehensive workflow:

1. **Advanced Search and Selection**:
   - Begins with an advanced search on museum websites, targeting all public domain images. This ensures the collection of only freely accessible and distributable images.

2. **URL Generation for Search Results**:
   - Generates URLs for all pages of the search results. This is done either through script-based pagination or by scraping search result pages.
   - Outputs the URLs into text or CSV files, creating a comprehensive list of pages containing the target images.

3. **Image URL Extraction**:
   - Scripts then scrape each page URL to extract individual image URLs. This step involves navigating through the structure of each page and identifying the correct elements that contain image URLs.
   - The extracted image URLs are saved in a structured format (text or CSV files), ready for the final downloading phase.

4. **Downloading Images and Metadata**:
   - The final scripts use the extracted image URLs to download images along with their corresponding metadata.
   - Special attention is given to handling web page interactions like cookie acceptance, dynamic content loading, and, in some cases, user authentication for downloading images.


## Key Features
- **Targeted Websites**: The collection includes specialized scripts for multiple museums.
- **Automation Efficiency**: Efficiently automates the extraction of large volumes of data amounting to over 1.3 million images and their associated metadata, significantly reducing manual effort and time.
- **Advanced Web Scraping**: Utilizes advanced web scraping techniques with Selenium and Python, handling complex web page interactions including cookie acceptance, dynamic content loading, and user authentication where necessary.
- **Customizability and Scalability**: Scripts are customizable and scalable, catering to the specific needs of each museum's digital archive.
- **User-Friendly Setup:** Scripts are packaged with PyInstaller for easy installation and use.

## Technical Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: Selenium for browser automation, Requests for efficient HTTP requests for data retrieval, BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, concurrent.futures for parallel processing, Pyinstaller for creating standalone executables for easy tool distribution, and others depending on specific project requirements.
- **Tools**: Custom WebDriver management, context managers, and error handling for robust script execution.
