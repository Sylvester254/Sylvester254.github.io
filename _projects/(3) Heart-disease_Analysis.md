This is a Command line Interface project designed to perform exploratory data analysis and advanced analysis on the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset. The user can choose to clean the data, explore the data, or perform advanced analysis on the data.

## Understanding Heart Disease through Data

Here, we delve into a dataset about heart disease to uncover patterns and make predictions. This project contains a script that analyzes data, creates visualizations, and builds a predictive model to understand heart health.

### What's Inside?

### 1. **Loading the Data**
   - **What it does:** We start by loading a dataset that contains information about different people and factors related to heart disease.
   - **Why it's important:** This is our first step to understanding what kind of data we're working with.

### 2. **Exploring the Data**
   - **What it does:** We take a closer look at the data to understand its structure, such as what kind of information is available and if there are any missing pieces.
   - **Why it's important:** This helps us get a sense of the data and identify any issues that need to be fixed before we proceed.

### 3. **Preparing the Data**
   - **What it does:** We clean and organize the data to make it ready for analysis. This includes handling missing information and converting text data into a format that can be understood by our predictive model.
   - **Why it's important:** Clean and well-organized data ensures that our analysis and predictions are accurate.

### 4. **Running the Analysis**
   - **What it does:** This is where everything comes together. We run all the steps in sequence to load, explore, visualize, prepare, and analyze the data.
   - **Why it's important:** This gives us a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and allows us to make informed predictions.

### 5. **Visualizing the Data**
   - **What it does:** We create visual charts and graphs to better understand the patterns and relationships in the data.
   - **Why it's important:** Visuals can often reveal insights and patterns that are not immediately obvious from the raw data alone.

## Why This Matters

Understanding heart disease is crucial as it is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. By analyzing data, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to heart disease and work towards better prevention and treatment strategies.
