## How it Works

### 1. **Temperature Monitoring**
   - **What it does:** Monitors the temperature of the compost pit using a DS18B20 temperature sensor.
   - **Why it's important:** Ensures that the composting process is occurring at an optimal temperature.

### 2. **Moisture Level Monitoring**
   - **What it does:** Checks the moisture level in the compost pit using an Analog Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor.
   - **Why it's important:** Maintains the right moisture level for efficient composting.

### 3. **Methane Gas Monitoring**
   - **What it does:** Monitors the level of methane gas produced in the compost pit using an MQ-4 sensor.
   - **Why it's important:** Keeps track of gas production and ensures safety.

### 4. **Real-time Alerts**
   - **What it does:** Provides real-time alerts and updates on the LCD screen and through LEDs.
   - **Why it's important:** Allows for timely intervention if any action is needed.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Uno:** Serves as the brain of the system, controlling all other components.
- **MQ-4 Sensor:** Detects methane gas levels.
- **DS18B20 Sensor:** Monitors temperature.
- **Analog Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor:** Checks soil moisture levels.
- **LCD Screen:** Displays real-time data and alerts.
- **LEDs:** Provide visual indicators of the compost status.

## Usage

The system is designed to be placed in a compost pit where it continuously monitors the conditions and displays real-time data on the LCD screen. LEDs are used to give a quick indication of the status of the composting process.

## Conclusion

This Smart Compost System is an efficient way to ensure that the composting process is carried out under optimal conditions. By providing real-time data and alerts, it allows for better management of the composting process.
